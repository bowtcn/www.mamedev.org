MAME 0.190

<p>The preservation train keeps rolling on with the scheduled September
release of MAME 0.190.  The Gaelco spree continues with Glass, Alligator
Hunt and Maniac Square, and we’ve added support for two games on the
hilariously misguided Tiger R-Zone system: Batman Forever and Indy 500.
Emulation has been greatly improved for Mazer Blazer, Great Guns, and
the Tecmo World Cup ’94 family of games, although all these games still
have issues with unemulated protection.</p>

<p>In computer emulation, we’ve added support for ZX Spectrum slot
devices.  You’ll still get the Kempston Joystick Interface by default,
but you can now swap it out for other devices, including a number of
Currah cartridges.  There are also some big improvements to the
HP9000/300 series, and support for HP85 option ROMs.</p>

<p>You can read about the rest of the improvements and newly supported
systems in the <a

file</a>, or get the source/Windows binaries from <a
href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">the download page</a> and try it
out.</p>
