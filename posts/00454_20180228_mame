MAME 0.195

<p>Whether you’re experiencing a cold snap in Spring or an Autumn
heatwave, we hope you’ll enjoy MAME 0.195 just in time for the last
day of February.  Goodies in this release include further
improvements to V.R. Technologies NES-derived hardware, a few more Tiger
handhelds, a number of Donkey Kong hacks, the original version of Gigas
Mark II, the official Taiwanese release of Street Fighter II': Champion
Edition, and more BBC Electron cartridges.  If you’re interested in
home-to-arcade conversions, you might want to check out the ultra-rare
Spanish title Hammer Boy, developed by Dinamic and brought to arcades by
Inder – it plays like an oversize Game &amp; Watch.</p>

<p>Namco NA1 emulation has been overhauled, with big visual improvements
for Numan Athletics and X-Day 2.  Background alignment has been fixed in
Popeye, and the driver has been cleaned up overall.  We’ve received lots
of patches from cam900, covering a large number of drivers.  As well as
a lot of code cleanup, highlights include ES5510 DSP effects for Taito’s
Ensoniq-based sound hardware, improved graphics priorities in Sand
Scorpion and Jackie Chan, graphical improvements in Data East MLC games
(Skull Fang is closer to working), and K051649 support in the vgmplay
driver.</p>

<p>Besides the new working systems, this release includes preliminary
support for a number of interesting systems.  These include the XaviX
platform (used for the Taito Nostalgia and Play TV/ConnecTV lines), the
Olympia BOSS, and the Panafacom Duet.  IPL-disable has been fixed for
Flash-based TI-8x series calculators.  At opposite ends of the spectrum,
graphics emulation is noticeably better for Sega Model 2 and the
Interpro workstations.  We’ve also added VM Labs Aries disassembly
support (this is the multi-core VLIW processor used in NUON-enhanced
DVD players).</p>

<p>This month, we’ve seen far more internal improvement, code cleanup
and modernisation than user-visible improvements.  This is all part of
our effort to make the code more maintainable, paving the way for future
improvements and keeping MAME relevant.  That said, the list of
emulation improvements and newly supported systems is quite impressive.
We’d like to thank all the contributors helping make MAME what it is
today.</p>
