MAME 0.189

<p>What better way to welcome southern Spring/northern Autumn than with
a MAME release?  MAME 0.189 brings general improvements across a broad
range of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>-sleep</tt> and <tt>-refreshspeed</tt> options have been
fixed (MAME will no longer use 100% of a CPU core for the least
demanding systems).</li>
<li>UI translations have been updated – Chinese, German and Greek are
fully up-to-date.</li>
<li>Many layout and navigation bugs in the system/software selection
menus have been fixed.</li>
<li>Slot card BIOS selection has been fixed.</li>
<li>Performance of machines that make heavy use of the output/artwork
system has been substantially improved.</li>
<li>Support for many more PNG features has been added.</li>
<li>A number of issues with XML system/device output have been
addressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are aware of the ongoing issues with the options system.  If this
completely breaks your use case, all we can recommend at this point is
to keep using MAME 0.187 until the issues are resolved.</p>

<p>MAME 0.189 adds support for several systems that many of us won’t
have had an opportunity to experience in real life.  Possibly most
interesting is the China Educational Computer I, an Apple II clone with
more memory, Chinese language support (pinyin input), and a built-in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>
interpreter.  Another interesting addition is the German Kontron
PSI98, a Z80-based computer with fairly advanced features.  Support
for the BBC Micro Tube interface has been added, allowing the use of
add-on coprocessor modules and by extension the software that takes
advantage of them.</p>

<p>On the arcade side, the protection code/data for Gaelco’s TH Strikes
Back has been dumped and the game now works.  The microcontrollers for
Toaplan’s Ghox and Whoopee have been dumped, adding sound to both games
and fixing graphical issues in Ghox.  The elusive world release
DoDonPachi III has been dumped and added. Gaelco’s Football Power is
also working in this release.  Handheld LCD game additions have slowed
down, but MAME 0.189 adds support for three Konami games: Garfield,
Football Power, and Bayou Billy.  Quite a few Mephisto modular chess
computers are now working.</p>

<p>MAME 0.189 adds support for a whole lot of newly dumped alternate
versions, bootlegs and hacks of arcade titles, and the usual assortment
of fixes, improvements, and code modernisations.  You can read about it
in the <a
