MAME 0.199

<p>Today’s the day for our mid-year MAME release.  MAME 0.199 includes
support for the incredibly elusive Spanish arcade title El Fin Del
Tiempo, and the rare Pac-Man hack Titan.  Other rare bootlegs added
include Come-Cocos (derived from Ms. Pac-Man) and Gran Rally (a Spanish
bootleg of Pole Position II).</p>

<p>There are some pretty big improvements to Tatsumi games (Apache 3,
Cycle Warriors, Round Up 5), some NMK mahjong games work substantially
better (Urashima Mahjong, Mahjong Daireikai, Mahjong Channel Zoom In),
and Big Run looks better than ever.  War: The Final Assault no longer
crashes thanks to a fix in Voodoo emulation.</p>

<p>Floppy drive emulation has been further improved, and a fairly major
issue with Apple IIgs and Mac 3.5" drives has been fixed.  Sound Blaster
direct DAC mode is now supported.  Improved Dreamcast GD-ROM emulation
allows Daytona USA 2001 to boot.  The HP 9000/300 series can now boot
from floppy, and the medium-resolution colour graphics option is
supported.  Tiger Electronics fans can enjoy Battle Arena Toshinden for
R-Zone.</p>

<p>Of course we’ve also added more alternate versions of supported
systems, software list updates, bug fixes, and internal improvements.
